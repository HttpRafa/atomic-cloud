# Atomic Cloud

Atomic Cloud is a cloud that was primarily developed for the game Minecraft, but it is possible to integrate other games with Atomic Cloud.

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and a way for me to learn Rust. Since it’s one of my first Rust apps, the code might not be perfect. You might notice things like too many locks or overusing Mutex, and I’m still figuring out some of Rust’s trickier features like lifetimes.

If you like the project, I’d love to hear your suggestions or corrections! Just keep it friendly and helpful. Instead of saying, "everything is bad" let me know what can be improved and how. Over time, the code will get better.
