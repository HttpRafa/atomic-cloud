# What is the CLI?

The **CLI** is an essential part of Atomic Cloud. Similar to how `kubectl` functions for Kubernetes, the CLI allows you to manage the cloud without needing to provide everyone with SSH access to the server.

# Installation
This guide provides instructions on how to download, install, and use the CLI tool for managing the controller.

## Step 1: Download
Download the latest CLI binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/HttpRafa/atomic-cloud/releases/).

## Step 2: Set Up PATH
Place the downloaded binary in a directory that is included in your system's PATH. This ensures you can run the CLI from any terminal session.

# Usage

  Open your terminal and run the CLI command.
