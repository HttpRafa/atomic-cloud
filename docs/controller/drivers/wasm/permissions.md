# Permissions

WASM drivers operate within a sandbox environment, which means they have very limited access to the host system by default. The WASI standard and the controller provide APIs to enable integration with network or local resources. However, you must grant the appropriate permissions to the driver you install to allow such access.

You can configure the permissions in the `configs/wasm.toml` file:

```bash
nano wasm.toml
```

```toml
# For more settings, please refer to the documentation:
# https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/cli-cache.html

[cache]
enabled = true

# This section is crucial for granting the drivers their required permissions
