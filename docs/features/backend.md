# Modular backend
Atomic Cloud has a "driver system" that allows the cloud to use whatever to start the server. Examples of backends are: Pterodactyl, Docker or normal servers (similar to CloudNet).
## What language can i use to write a driver?
-> The plugins use WebAssembly and the WASI standard, so compatibility is very limited. My recommendation is to write the drivers in Rust or use TeaVM for Java.
## Currently existing drivers
