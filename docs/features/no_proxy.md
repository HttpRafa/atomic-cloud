# No Proxy Usage

Atomic Cloud is engineered using the latest Minecraft transfer packet technology, eliminating the need for traditional proxy software such as Velocity or BungeeCord. This innovative approach provides several key advantages:

## Advantages of No Proxy

### Reduced Latency

By removing the proxy layer, Atomic Cloud minimizes network overhead, significantly reducing latency. This results in a smoother and more responsive gaming experience for players.

### Regional Player Distribution

Without a centralized proxy, players can be seamlessly distributed based on their geographical regions. This not only improves server performance but also enhances the overall player experience by connecting them to the nearest available server.

### Enhanced Network Stability

Eliminating the proxy creates a more resilient network architecture. Without a single point of failure, the system is better protected against crashes. For instance, if a lobby experiences a failure, a new lobby is automatically initiated on a random port, making it more challenging for attackers to target and disrupt the network consistently.

Atomic Cloud's no-proxy design ensures a robust, efficient, and secure environment, providing significant performance improvements and increased reliability for all players.
