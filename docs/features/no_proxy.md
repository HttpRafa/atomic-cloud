# Does not use proxies
Atomic Cloud is designed from the ground up with the new Minecraft transfer packet which means there is no need to use proxy software like Velocity or Bungeecord.

## Why is this better?
The primary benefit of removing a proxy is the *reduced latency* and the ability to easily *split players based on their region*. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to *crash the entire network* using crashing methods as there is no single point of failure. If you manage to crash the lobby, a new one starts on a new random port that must first be found before a new attack can be launched.
