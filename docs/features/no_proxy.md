# No Proxy Usage

Atomic Cloud is engineered from the ground up utilizing the latest Minecraft transfer packet technology, eliminating the need for proxy software such as Velocity or Bungeecord.

## Advantages of No Proxy

### Reduced Latency
By removing the proxy layer, Atomic Cloud significantly reduces latency, providing a smoother and more responsive gaming experience.

### Regional Player Distribution
The absence of a proxy allows for seamless distribution of players based on their geographical regions, enhancing server performance and player experience.

### Enhanced Network Stability
Without a single point of failure, the network becomes more resilient to crashes. In the event of a lobby crash, a new lobby is automatically initiated on a random port, making it difficult for attackers to disrupt the network consistently.

Atomic Cloud's innovative approach ensures a robust, efficient, and secure environment for all players.
