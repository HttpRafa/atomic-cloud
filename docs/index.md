# Welcome

Welcome to the **Atomic Cloud** project! Please note that the cloud is currently in its **early development stages**, and you might encounter occasional bugs. If you experience any issues, please report them by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HttpRafa/atomic-cloud).

## Documentation Status ðŸš§

This documentation is a work in progress. We apologize for any grammatical errors or incomplete sections. We welcome contributions from the communityâ€”if youâ€™d like to help improve the documentation, please consider submitting a Pull Request.

## Installation

Atomic Cloud comprises two main components: the **Controller** and the **CLI**. Below are the recommended installation options:

- **Docker Installation**: We recommend installing via a Docker image for ease of deployment. Follow the instructions in our [Docker Installation Guide](installation/docker.md).
- **Standard Installation**: If you prefer not to use Docker, refer to our [Standard Installation Guide](installation/normal.md).

### Controller

The [Controller](usage/controller/index.md) is designed to run in a continuously operating environment, such as a Raspberry Pi or a cloud server. It is responsible for managing the core functionalities of the cloud system.

### CLI

The [CLI](usage/cli/index.md) is a client application that allows you to interact with the Controller. You can install it on your local machine to manage the cloud system conveniently.
