## Installation
The Atomic Cloud consists of two main components: the Controller and the CLI. The Recommended Installation through a Docker Image can be found [here](installation/docker.md). If you aren't using Docker the normal installation can be found [here](installation/normal.md).

### Controller
The [Controller](usage/controller/index.md) should be installed in an environment that can operate continuously, such as a Raspberry Pi or a cloud server. It is responsible for managing the core functionalities of the cloud system.

### CLI
The [CLI](usage/cli/index.md) is a client application that allows you to interact with the Controller. It can be installed on your local computer, providing you with convenient access to manage the cloud system.
