# Available Options

Currently, Atomic Cloud offers only one option: a **local** version (similar to **CloudNet**). Additionally, there is a plugin designed to integrate with **Pelican**, but it is still being ported to the rewritten controller.

If you have a unique integration requirement, you are welcome to create your own WASM plugin. Simply develop the plugin and place it in the Plugins directory on a WASM-enabled Controller.
