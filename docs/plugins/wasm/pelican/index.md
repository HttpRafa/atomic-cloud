# Installation
> **Note:**  
> This plugin is currently being ported to a rewritten controller. Therefore, it is only available for versions below v0.6.0-alpha of the controller and only supports Pterodactyl, not Pelican. The rewrite will support Pelican, so please keep that in mind.

1. Download the `pelican-plugin.wasm` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/HttpRafa/atomic-cloud/releases/).
2. Place the downloaded file into the `plugins` directory.
3. Start the controller.
