# Introduction

The Controller is designed with extensibility in mind, supporting a wide range of plugin platforms. Currently, the primary platform for developing plugins is WebAssembly (WASM) using the WASI Preview 2 specification. This approach provides a flexible, high-performance environment for plugin development.

If you prefer not to use a WASM plugin or have alternative ideas, you are welcome to implement your own plugin mechanism. We encourage community contributionsâ€”feel free to submit a pull request with your enhancements or alternative implementations.
