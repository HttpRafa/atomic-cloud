Currently, there is only one Plugin that integrates the Pterodactyl panel into the controller. A local version similar to CloudNet is planned, as well as a local Docker daemon version. If you need to integrate something unique, feel free to create a WASM Plugin and place it in the Plugins directory on a WASM-enabled controller.
