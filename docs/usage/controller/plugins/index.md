# Introduction

The Controller is built with extensibility at its core, supporting a wide array of plugin platforms. At present, the primary platform for developing plugins is **WebAssembly (WASM)**, leveraging the **WASI Preview 2** specification. This modern approach delivers a flexible and high-performance environment for plugin development.

If you prefer not to use a WASM plugin or have alternative ideas, you are welcome to implement your own plugin mechanism. We encourage community contributionsâ€”feel free to submit a pull request with your enhancements or alternative implementations.
