Currently, Atomic Cloud offers a single plugin that integrates the **Pterodactyl** panel into the Controller. In the future, we plan to introduce additional plugins, including:

- **Local Version (similar to CloudNet)**
- **Local Docker Daemon Version**

If you have a unique integration requirement, you are welcome to create your own WASM plugin. Simply develop the plugin and place it in the Plugins directory on a WASM-enabled Controller.
