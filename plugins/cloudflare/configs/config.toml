# NOTE: This plugin will delete all DNS records under the DNS name specified in the tasks array.
# Be cautious when using the "prepend" type with your root domain, as it may unintentionally remove other SRV records on the domain.
# The plugin assumes any records matching to the DNS name are leftovers and will delete them.
# If the type is set to "static," it will only delete records that are exactly under the DNS name.
[[tasks]]
# Task type: can be "static" or "prepend" (prepends the server name to the DNS record, e.g., lobby-1.mynetwork.net)
type = "static"
